# knn-python

This repository has the objective of displaying some reimplementations of the [K-Nearest Neighbors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm) algorithm, solving both classification and regression problems.

I am using jupyter-notebook to make it easier to visualize and understand the code implementations.

Some of the implementations are using just Python, without any external libraries, willing to really understand how the algorithm works. Having it understood, I started using some external libraries, such as NumPy and Scikit-learn.

The creation of this repository was inspired by some exercises from the Udemy course called [Machine Learning and Data Science with Python](https://www.udemy.com/machine-learning-e-data-science-com-python/learn/v4/overview) (Its content is in brazilian Portuguese).

Hope you enjoyed and learned anything from this repository :)
